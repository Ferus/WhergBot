Currently, Level/Hostchecking seems to make the bot slower. I don't think threading that would work. But then again, Ive barely used threading.
In Commands.py, the number in self.cmds is the access level needed to use the command, If someone has an access level higher than the highest number 
	in there, they will be ignored for everything but CTCP/DCC
	
UrbanDictionary.py assumes there is a file called UrbanDict_Cache.txt in the plugins folder.
The above will be fixed. (I hope)
