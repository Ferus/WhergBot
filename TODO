1: Change how the parser handles messages, and more options
	
2: Add a plugins folder and add them to Commands.py
	- Anything imported will need to be defined in __init__() (IE: meme.py)
	- Finish others
					
3: NickServ auth options.

4: Move everything to a config file?

5: Add showing when you cannot join a channel because lolbanned

6: Investigate why I cant add a : when using $raw privmsg
	- String parsing " : " when adding quotes. everything past that isnt added.
	
7: Find a way to make plugins hook themselves. they would have to init when imported, but that means they would probably have to import Commands, Make them add to the cmds dict.
	try/except to pass plugins like MpdScript that require another module
	a blank dictionary/list/something that holds the names of all the loaded modules

8: Dont import plugins that require modules that are not installed.
	- Mainly mpdscript.py
	

#### PLUGINS ####

1: Youtube URL reporter
	- Reports likes/dislikes and other video stats based on a link

2: FuckMyLife
	- Name says it all.
	
3: DuckDuckGo

4: Services
	- Nickserv
	- Any other service that might be wanted
	- Kick, Ban, Unban, Kban, etc. (Need to update blackbox for this)

5: Guess

6: Slap
	- Now that i have a working dict that holds users of a channel ;D
7: http://www.insultgenerator.org/
