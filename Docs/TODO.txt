Web Interface?
	Plugins should be able to hook into this if needed.
	from Plugins import WebInterface ?
	Modular, has an add_page/tab() or similar
	html templates?

Sending Buffer/Queue
	allow hooks to be called when send()ing data as well as recv()ing

Youtube:
	Support for Youtu.be links.

Wheel Of Fortune

UrbanDictionary.py:
	Change to API url, using json to get def instead of parsing with shitty regex.

Pyborg:
	pyborg needs to replace channel nicks with $NICK for incoming messages
	and replace all $NICK in outgoing messages with the name of the person
	on IRC that triggered that message, if $NICK exists in the message

	On that note, it requires that Wherg hold a channel list of names.
	This should include channel modes and each users mod level (as a number)
	
channels = {
	"Channel": [
		[user, list, here], chanmodes
		]
	,"Channel2": etc
}


Next rewrite:

All Settings use YAML
Sane plugin system:
	A default plugin class with predefined hooks/etc
	A sane way of storing init'd plugins
	Optional config file for plugin class
	Plugin system should have locking/threading boolean settings when hooking commands
