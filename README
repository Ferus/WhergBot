=== Required Modules (That aren't built in)===
It is highly recommended to use the latest source for each of these.

BlackBox (Develop Branch) - https://github.com/proxypoke/blackbox_IRC-macros/
BlackBox is a great module that's built over the IRC protocol. It's used here to manage connections to an IRC server.

Requests - https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests
Requests is a very nice frontend to urllib2 and is used widely in many WhergBot Plugins.

Python-Mpd - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-mpd/
This module is used in Plugins/MpdScript.py and allows WhergBot to show the current song playing in MPD.
